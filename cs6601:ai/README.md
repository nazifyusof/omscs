# Class Goals
By the end of this course, we would achieve the following goals:

- Foundation: We should build a strong foundation in classic AI techniques like game playing, search, constraint satisfaction, logic and planning, machine learning, graphical models, etc.
- Skills: We should be able to propose, evaluate, and implement solutions to problems requiring AI techniques.
- Integration: We should be aware of where AI intersects with other disciplines, primarily machine learning and perception.
- Assessment: We should have experienced different flavors of problems and solutions, and have developed a taste for some; We should also have confidence in how and where AI can be applied in problems relevant to society.
