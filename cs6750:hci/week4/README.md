# 2.6: Mental Models and Representations
- An internal, simulatable understanding of external reality

## Mental Models
- A person's understanding of how something works in the real world
- We generate expectations based on our mental models
- When reality does not match our mental model, it makes us uncomfortable
- We wanna make sure our designs match users' mental models
- There are two ways
  - Designing systems that act the way the use expects them to act
  - Designing systems that teach users how they react, to minimize discomfort

## Mental Models and Education
- Our goal is to teach users through the design of the interface
- Teach users WHILE they are using damn

## 5 tips: Mental Models for Learnable Interfaces
- Predictability
  - Can the user predict what will happen next?
- Synthesizability
  - User should be able to see the sequence of actions that led to their current state
- Familiarity
  - Similar to affordances
- Generalizability
  - Knowledge of one user interface should transfer to another similar interface
- Consistency
  - Behavior of action should be consistent across interfaces

## Representations
![img.png](img.png)
- One example is assembly instructions
- Arrows, labels, and exploded views are all representations

## Characteristics of Good Representations
- Good representations:
  - make relationships explicit
  - bring objects and relations together
  - excludes extraneous details
  - expose natural constraints

## Design Challenge: Representations
- Switch box
  - Make the circuit breakers writeable what they control
  - Floor plan on the door with number labels
  - Switch arranged according to the floor plan (crazy)

## Metaphors and Analogies
- Metaphors
  - WSJ articles are the same for printed and online versions
- Analogies
  - We can think of a computer desktop like a real desktop
  - Comparing new concepts to familiar ones
  - When you use analogies, users may not know where the analogy ends

## Exploring HCI: Metaphors and Analogies
- 

## Design Principles Revisited
- We want to be consistent around analogies and metaphors
- They way system looks should match the way it works
- good representations are important because it maps the interface to the task at hand

## New Functionality Meets Old Interfaces
- Innovation
- While we need to leverage analogy and prior experience wherever possible, eventually we're going to do something and it gonna break down
- We gonna need to teach user how to use new functionality

## Learning Curves
![img_1.png](img_1.png)
![img_2.png](img_2.png)
- We want a learning curve that grows quickly with little experience
- Rapid learning curve: expertise grows quickly, with relatively lesser experience
- If we use affordances and good representations, we can start expertise at a higher level

## User Error: Slips and Mistakes
![img_3.png](img_3.png)
- Any user error is a failure of design


- Slips
  - user has the right mental model, but does the wrong thing anyway
- Mistakes
  - User has the wrong mental model, so they do the wrong thing

## Types of Slips
- Two categories:
  - Action-based
    - user performs the wrong or right action, on the wrong object even tho they know the right action
  - Memory-lapse
    - Forget what they knew to do
    - e.g. set timer on microwave but forget to start it

## Types of Mistakes
- 3 categories
  - Rule-based
    - occur where user correctly assesses the state of world, but makes the wrong decision based on it
  - Knowledge-based
    - incorrectly asses the world in the first place
  - Memory-lapse
    - Focuses on forgetting to fully execute the plan, not just forget to do something in the first place

## Exercise: Slips vs Mistakes
- Q: Morgan accidentally sends a text message to the wrong person. Is this a slip or a mistake?
- A: Slip, Morgan knew who to text, but selected the wrong contact
- More pervasive reminders who Morgan is texting

## Learned Helplessness
- What if no discernible interaction between input and output?
- Act in the system over and over again, but nothing changes
- This is what learned helplessness is
- A user's sense that they are helpless to accomplish their goals in an interface
- Can lead to frustration, anxiety, and abandonment of the system
- No one wants to feel helpless, when others are succeeding

## Learned Helplessness and Education 
- In teaching, if students feel like no matter what they do, they can't succeed
- If you're a parent and designer, imagine you are the user and your screaming kid is the interface
- What feedback would you need from your child to help them, and what can you add in that interface

## Expert Blind Spot
- When you're expert, we do task subconsciously
- Lots of things we forgot to say when teaching novices
- Make sure you don't assume that they're expert too, we are not our users!!!
- REPEAT IT!! I AM NOT MY USERS!!!

## Reflections: Learned Helplessness and Expert Blind Spot
- It's important for us to understand to be in the position of helplessness

# 2.7: Task Analysis
- The task is at the heart of HCI

## GOMS Model
![img_4.png](img_4.png)
- Human information processing model
- It builds off the processor of the human's role in a system
- GOMS stands for Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules
  - Goals: what the user is trying to accomplish
  - Operators: the basic actions the user can take to accomplish the goal
  - Methods: methods for accomplishing the goal using operators
  - Selection rules: guidelines for choosing between different methods

## GOMS Model in Action
![img_5.png](img_5.png)

## Design Challenge: Security System 1
![img_6.png](img_6.png)

## Strengths and Weaknesses of GOMS
- Weakness
  - Don't address the complexity of the problems
  - Assumes user is an expert
- Strength
  - Formalize user interaction
  
## Paper Spotlight: The GOMS Family of User Interface Analysis Techniques Comparison and Contrast
- KLM-GOMS: Keystroke-Level Model
- CMN-GOMS: Card, Moran, and Newell GOMS
- NGOMSL: Natural GOMS Language

## 5 Tips: Developing GOMS Models
- Focus on small goals
  - Work in the context of small goals, and abstract up
- Nest goals, not operators
  - Navigation: changing lanes or switch routes
- Differentiate descriptive and prescriptive methods
  - Descriptive: how users actually do
  - Prescriptive: how users should do 
- Assign cost to operators
  - Have some measurement how long each operator takes
- Use GOMS to trim waste
  - GOMS let's us visualize the operators, bolstered by the costs, we can see where we can trim waste

## GOMS to Cognitive Task Analysis
- Another way of examine task, but place higher emphasis on things like memory, attention, and cognitive load
- Adapt predictive view of human role in the system

## Reflections: Task Analysis
- Behaviorism: an approach to psychology that emphasizes behavior as a product of stimuli and the environment
- Cognitivism: an approach to psychology that emphasizes internal thought processes
- Both approaches has significant values

## Cognitive Task Analysis
![img_9.png](img_9.png)
- Type of method of evaluation of how people complete task
- Cognitive task analyses are concerned with the underlying thought process associated with performing a task
- Most methods follow this sequence
  - Collecting preliminary knowledge. Need a good bit of familiarity with the task
  - Identify knowledge representations. What kind of things user need to know to complete the task. 
  - Apply focused knowledge elicitation methods. Identify all specific actions, knowledge they must have in mind, interruptions that can change the thought process, equipments involved and sensory experiences
  - Analyze and verify data acquired
  - Format results for intended application

## Hierarchical Task Analysis
![img_7.png](img_7.png)
![img_8.png](img_8.png)
- Advocates building models of human reasoning and decision-making in complex task
- Tips
  - Abstract out unnecessary details for a certain level of abstraction
  - modularize designs or principles so they can be transferred to different task or context
  - organize the cognitive task analysis in a way that makes it easier to understand
- There will be several level of abstractions, different states and additional annotating info

## Design Challenge: Security System 2


## Cognitive Task Analysis Strengths and Weaknesses
- Strengths
  - Emphasize mental processes
  - Formal enough for interface design
- Weaknesses
- Can be time-consuming
  - Time-intensive
  - May de-emphasize context
  - ill-suited for novices

## Other Task Analysis Frameworks

  - KLM: Keystroke-Level Model
  - TLM: Task-Level Model
  - MHP: Model Human Processor
  - CPM-GOMS: Cognitive Perceptual Motor GOMS
  - NGOMSL: Natural GOMS Language

  - CFM: Cognitive Function Model
  - Applied CTA
  - Skill-based CTA

# 3.5: Prototyping
- We want to actually build things that we can put infront of users
- Want to get feedback and get more complex over time

##  Basics of Prototyping
![img_10.png](img_10.png)
![img_11.png](img_11.png)
![img_12.png](img_12.png)
![img_13.png](img_13.png)
- Early vs Late Prototyping
- Four main concepts:
  - Representation
    - Verbal
    - Paper
    - Physical
    - Wireframe
    - Functional
    - Wizard of Oz
    - Live
  - Fidelity
    - Low: easy to change
    - High: harder to put together
  - Evaluation
    - Function
    - Interface
    - Performance
  - Scope
    - Horizontal: cover the designs aas whole, but shallow
    - Vertical: deep dive into a few aspects of the design

## Tradeoffs in Prototyping
- Low fidelity
  - Pros
    - easy to create
  - Cons
    - not detailed enough
- High fidelity
  - pros
    - more detailed
  - cons
    - time-consuming
- low fidelity -> high fidelity over time

## 5 Tips: Prototyping
- Keep prototypes easy to change
  - rapid revision and improvement
- Make it clear that it's a prototype
  - if we make it too good, they will look at superficial elements like colors and fonts
- Be creative
  - Our goal is get feedback
- Evaluate risks
  - One of biggest goal of prototyping is to minimize time to pursuing bad design
  - HOW MUCH WOULD YOU LOSE IF YOU FOUND THAT USERS HATES THE PARTS OF YUOR DESIGN THAT THEY HAVENT SEEN YET?
  - If more than couple of hours, try to get feedback so we dont waste time
- Prototype for feedback
  - prototype for the kind of feedback you want to get, not just colors or fonts

## Verbal Prototypes
- Social desirability bias
  - People wanna be nice to you
  - They may not wanna hurt your feelings
- Expert blind-spot
  - analogies can be powerful tool to explain prototupe

## Paper Prototyping
- Draw them out
- Basic layout info
- Easy to change
- Card prototyping: can do some interaction with it: interface 1 in paper 1, click button, then go to interface 2 in paper 2

## Wizard of Oz
- We, behind the curtain, do the things that the interface would do once it's actually implemented
- That way, we can test out the interaction that we plan to design and how well it works
- E.g. audiobook, person A is the user, person B is the wizard who turns pages when user says "next"

## Wireframing
- We use some more detailed tools to mark up what details to look like
- Font size, colors, layout
- Can do it powerpoint, google drawings, paid product axure and balsamiq
- Free tools: PencilProject and Framebox

## Physical Prototypes
- It doesn't have to actually work
- Lots of elements we can test without actually making it work
- Bluetooth device that can press button, we can just make a fake one that looks like it or just a cardboard cutout
- Evaluate the intuitiveness of the design
- Hold something in your hand to see how it feels or works in the real world in different contexts

## Exercise: Prototyping Pros and cons
![img_14.png](img_14.png)

## Design Life Cycle Revisited
- We go around the design life cycle multiple times
- Over time, we go from low fidelity to high fidelity as we go around the cycle multiple times

## Multi-Level Prototyping
- Use sketches first, then wireframes, then functional prototypes
- Bottom-up approach: design individual screens first, then design overall screen flow
- Top-down approach: design overall screen flow first, then design individual screens
- The points of this is that at any time, prototyping can and should exist at multiple levels of fidelity

## Exploring HCI: Prototyping
- Need to get creative with prototyping
- Gesture or voice interface, we can use Wizard of Oz
- AR? Need to get creative
