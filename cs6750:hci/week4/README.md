# 2.6: Mental Models and Representations
- An internal, simulatable understanding of external reality

## Mental Models
- A person's understanding of how something works in the real world
- We generate expectations based on our mental models
- When reality does not match our mental model, it makes us uncomfortable
- We wanna make sure our designs match users' mental models
- There are two ways
  - Designing systems that act the way the use expects them to act
  - Designing systems that teach users how they react, to minimize discomfort

## Mental Models and Education
- Our goal is to teach users through the design of the interface
- Teach users WHILE they are using damn

## 5 tips: Mental Models for Learnable Interfaces
- Predictability
  - Can the user predict what will happen next?
- Synthesizability
  - User should be able to see the sequence of actions that led to their current state
- Familiarity
  - Similar to affordances
- Generalizability
  - Knowledge of one user interface should transfer to another similar interface
- Consistency
  - Behavior of action should be consistent across interfaces

## Representations
![img.png](img.png)
- One example is assembly instructions
- Arrows, labels, and exploded views are all representations

## Characteristics of Good Representations
- Good representations:
  - make relationships explicit
  - bring objects and relations together
  - excludes extraneous details
  - expose natural constraints

## Design Challenge: Representations
- Switch box
  - Make the circuit breakers writeable what they control
  - Floor plan on the door with number labels
  - Switch arranged according to the floor plan (crazy)

## Metaphors and Analogies
- Metaphors
  - WSJ articles are the same for printed and online versions
- Analogies
  - We can think of a computer desktop like a real desktop
  - Comparing new concepts to familiar ones
  - When you use analogies, users may not know where the analogy ends

## Exploring HCI: Metaphors and Analogies
- 

## Design Principles Revisited
- We want to be consistent around analogies and metaphors
- They way system looks should match the way it works
- good representations are important because it maps the interface to the task at hand

## New Functionality Meets Old Interfaces
- Innovation
- While we need to leverage analogy and prior experience wherever possible, eventually we're going to do something and it gonna break down
- We gonna need to teach user how to use new functionality

## Learning Curves
![img_1.png](img_1.png)
![img_2.png](img_2.png)
- We want a learning curve that grows quickly with little experience
- Rapid learning curve: expertise grows quickly, with relatively lesser experience
- If we use affordances and good representations, we can start expertise at a higher level

## User Error: Slips and Mistakes
![img_3.png](img_3.png)
- Any user error is a failure of design


- Slips
  - user has the right mental model, but does the wrong thing anyway
- Mistakes
  - User has the wrong mental model, so they do the wrong thing

## Types of Slips
- Two categories:
  - Action-based
    - user performs the wrong or right action, on the wrong object even tho they know the right action
  - Memory-lapse
    - Forget what they knew to do
    - e.g. set timer on microwave but forget to start it

## Types of Mistakes
- 3 categories
  - Rule-based
    - occur where user correctly assesses the state of world, but makes the wrong decision based on it
  - Knowledge-based
    - incorrectly asses the world in the first place
  - Memory-lapse
    - Focuses on forgetting to fully execute the plan, not just forget to do something in the first place

## Exercise: Slips vs Mistakes
- Q: Morgan accidentally sends a text message to the wrong person. Is this a slip or a mistake?
- A: Slip, Morgan knew who to text, but selected the wrong contact
- More pervasive reminders who Morgan is texting

## Learned Helplessness
- What if no discernible interaction between input and output?
- Act in the system over and over again, but nothing changes
- This is what learned helplessness is
- A user's sense that they are helpless to accomplish their goals in an interface
- Can lead to frustration, anxiety, and abandonment of the system
- No one wants to feel helpless, when others are succeeding

## Learned Helplessness and Education 
- In teaching, if students feel like no matter what they do, they can't succeed
- If you're a parent and designer, imagine you are the user and your screaming kid is the interface
- What feedback would you need from your child to help them, and what can you add in that interface

## Expert Blind Spot
- When you're expert, we do task subconsciously
- Lots of things we forgot to say when teaching novices
- Make sure you don't assume that they're expert too, we are not our users!!!
- REPEAT IT!! I AM NOT MY USERS!!!

## Reflections: Learned Helplessness and Expert Blind Spot
- It's important for us to understand to be in the position of helplessness

# 2.7: Task Analysis
- The task is at the heart of HCI

## GOMS Model
![img_4.png](img_4.png)
- Human information processing model
- It builds off the processor of the human's role in a system
- GOMS stands for Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules
  - Goals: what the user is trying to accomplish
  - Operators: the basic actions the user can take to accomplish the goal
  - Methods: methods for accomplishing the goal using operators
  - Selection rules: guidelines for choosing between different methods

## GOMS Model in Action
![img_5.png](img_5.png)

## Design Challenge: Security System 1
![img_6.png](img_6.png)

## Strengths and Weaknesses of GOMS
- Weakness
  - Don't address the complexity of the problems
  - Assumes user is an expert
- Strength
  - Formalize user interaction
  
## Paper Spotlight: The GOMS Family of User Interface Analysis Techniques Comparison and Contrast
- KLM-GOMS: Keystroke-Level Model
- CMN-GOMS: Card, Moran, and Newell GOMS
- NGOMSL: Natural GOMS Language

## 5 Tips: Developing GOMS Models
- Focus on small goals
  - Work in the context of small goals, and abstract up
- Nest goals, not operators
  - Navigation: changing lanes or switch routes
- Differentiate descriptive and prescriptive methods
  - Descriptive: how users actually do
  - Prescriptive: how users should do 
- Assign cost to operators
  - Have some measurement how long each operator takes
- Use GOMS to trim waste
  - GOMS let's us visualize the operators, bolstered by the costs, we can see where we can trim waste

## GOMS to Cognitive Task Analysis
- Another way of examine task, but place higher emphasis on things like memory, attention, and cognitive load
- Adapt predictive view of human role in the system

## Reflections: Task Analysis
- Behaviorism: an approach to psychology that emphasizes behavior as a product of stimuli and the environment
- Cognitivism: an approach to psychology that emphasizes internal thought processes
- Both approaches has significant values

## Cognitive Task Analysis
![img_9.png](img_9.png)
- Type of method of evaluation of how people complete task
- Cognitive task analyses are concerned with the underlying thought process associated with performing a task
- Most methods follow this sequence
  - Collecting preliminary knowledge. Need a good bit of familiarity with the task
  - Identify knowledge representations. What kind of things user need to know to complete the task. 
  - Apply focused knowledge elicitation methods. Identify all specific actions, knowledge they must have in mind, interruptions that can change the thought process, equipments involved and sensory experiences
  - Analyze and verify data acquired
  - Format results for intended application

## Hierarchical Task Analysis
![img_7.png](img_7.png)
![img_8.png](img_8.png)
- Advocates building models of human reasoning and decision-making in complex task
- Tips
  - Abstract out unnecessary details for a certain level of abstraction
  - modularize designs or principles so they can be transferred to different task or context
  - organize the cognitive task analysis in a way that makes it easier to understand
- There will be several level of abstractions, different states and additional annotating info

## Design Challenge: Security System 2


## Cognitive Task Analysis Strengths and Weaknesses
- Strengths
  - Emphasize mental processes
  - Formal enough for interface design
- Weaknesses
- Can be time-consuming
  - Time-intensive
  - May de-emphasize context
  - ill-suited for novices

  - TLM: Task-Level Model
  - MHP: Model Human Processor
  - CPM-GOMS: Cognitive Perceptual Motor GOMS
