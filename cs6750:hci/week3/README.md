# 2.4: Direct Manipulation

## Direct Manipulation The Desktop Metaphor 1
- Files and folders in desktops are to mimic physical files and folders
- Pick files and put them in folders
- Would it narrow the gulf of execution if we mimic physical actions?


- Previously use of command line interfaces to manipulate files
- Then computer mouse came along, made it easier to point and click
- GUI made it easier to drag and drop files into folders
- However, there is still a gap for novice users
- Touch screens make it even easier to directly manipulate objects on screen


## Paper Spotlight: Direct Manipulation Interfaces
- Hutchins, Hollan, and Norman (1985)
- Becoming a more common design strategy
- Two aspect of directness
  - Distance between the user's goal and the system. The greateer the cognitive load, the less direct the interface
    - Semantic distance: user's goal and expression in the system, how hard is it to do
    - Articulatory distance: expression and execution, how hard is to do the action when you know what to do
  - Direct engagement
    - If we're moving files, we want to see the files moving
    - In game, we should directly control our avatar
    - Diret manipulation is a powerful tool to shorten the distance

## Exploring HCI: Direct Manipulation and VR
- Able to view what they deign in 3d
- Move around the object to get angles
- Directly manipulate the object with hands

## Babies and Direct Manipulation
- Watching a baby to user interface
- Games made for cats, even better!

## Making Indirect Manipulation More Direct
- Mac touchpad: pinching to zoom in and out, swipe to bring up notification center
- Spread out fingers to clear the windows, like clearing off your desk, but isnt really direct, but the motion mimics physical action

## Exploring HCI: Direct Manipulation
- Direct Manipulation is contingent on the immediate feedback that maps directly to the interaction
- How does VR do direct manipulation kinesthetically?

## Invincible Interfaces
- We make the interface to be invisible
- The feel like they are not using an interface, but working directly with the task
- Draw with an apple pen on iPad, it feels like drawing on paper
- Contrast that with drawing on a computer with a mouse, it feels indirect, ugly writing

## Good Design - Bad Design Invisible Interfaces
- Good design: interfaces that are metaphorically invisible
- Bad design: interfaces that are literally invisible, kind of xD, must give direct feedback else users get lost without any clue of what is going on

## Invisibility by Learning
- Driving, discover i am headed for someone, we hit the brake and rotate the steering wheel
- We practice these actions so much that we don't think about them anymore
- Driving is important enough that we can have a higher learning curve
- But interface we design, we can't expect users to go through a high learning curve
- Our goal is below

## Invisibility by Design
- Should feel immediately as if they're interacting with the task, underlying the interface
- When we do things right, people won't be aware we done anything at all

## 5 tips: Invisible Interfaces
- Use affordances
  - visual design of the interface is just how it's supposed to be used
  - Buttons for turning, dials for turning
- Know your user
- Differentiate your user
  - Novice vs expert
  - copy and past in menu vs cntrl-c, ctrl-v
- Let your interface teach
  - When user select copy from Edit menu, they see the hotkey for shotcur
- Ask the user
  - How the user feels
  - Note especially they're talking about the task or the interface
  - If the talk about the interface, then it's pretty visible

## Reflections: Invisible By Design
- usually in game, people move joystick up to look up
- but some people move joystick down to look up, like in airplane
- in portal 2 game, instead of updating in control settings menu, they do it in-game
- If buzzer sounds, user immediately lookup, then the control is updated


## Design Challenge: Universal Remote
- Voice interface for remote control
  - Command is non-discoverable, need it to understand natural language
