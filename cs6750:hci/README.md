# Learning Goals
- Understand common principles in HCI
- understand design lifecycle, role of iteration in the process
- understand current application of HCI

# Learning Outcomes
- Design effective interactions between humans and computers
    - Apply known principles to a new problem
    - An iterative process of needfinding, prototyping, evaluation, and revising
    - Design is a mix of not ignoring decades of experience when designing new interfaces and apply known principles to new problems
- Effective interactions
    - Usability
    - Research
    - Change that activity
        - e.g. encourage people to use less, electricity bill bla bla
- Between humans and computers
    - Human's role in interactions
    - We design interactions, not the interfaces
    - Thermostat, we don't design the thermostat, we design the way a person control the temperature in their home e.g. Nest

# Learning Strategies
- Learning by example - research
- Learning by doing - design interactions
- Learn by reflections - we are not our own user! Use some strategies to get out from out comfort zone


- Peer learing, collaborative learning, learning by teaching, communities of practice
- Project-based learning, to explore the principles and methods of HCI

# Learning Assessments
- Design effective interactions between human and users
- Scope up towards a bigger challenge as wwe go along the class
- We'l be evaluated not just by design, but also the process how we generate it


# Course Structure
- Core design principles of HCI
- Research methodologies
- Peak at what's going on in HCI community at large

# Tips for doing well

Tips:
- Look at assignment early
- Start early
- Participate in class
- Select an application area to explore, pick area that interest us
- Leave behind what we know, be cautious about designing to narrowly based only on our EXPERIENCES
